Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. More info on the meanings of words like delegates, and NS
2. Breaking down code more line by line

## Notes

While writing this app I strugled with just looking at the video and doing copying it. However I realized that that was not helping me so I started over and worked through it on my own. I am glad I did this because I learned alot from this assignment by doing so.
